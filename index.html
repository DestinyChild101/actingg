  <h1>My experience with Acting </h1>
<div id="intro">
   <p> Acting is never easy especially on the days of the performance. You have the pre-show jitters, the sweats, the fear of forgetting your lines, or just embarrassing yourself in general. </p>
</div>
   <p>Why I did it in the first place? I don’t even know</p>
<div class="steps">
    <h1>My experience with characters</h1>
   <p> When acting, you really have to get into a character no matter how hard it is, and trust me it can be hard. In every play I ever did I always played a crazy character like I don’t know if the people who cast me think I have a crazy persona or something but I’m a pretty chill person. One time I played a crazy cat owner who was obsessed with her cat, that wasn’t even the worst part, the worst part was that my cat's hair ended up killing me, like what?!? Another time I played this girl who was a hopeless romantic and she was in love, and when I say in love I mean in love. The messed-up part was that the boy she was in love with loved her sister...... Typical Shakespeare. Anyway, my point is that you really have to get into your character. No matter how embarrassing it is lol.    </p>

   <h1>Performance Day!!!</h1>
   <p>Performance Day is always nerve wrecking. Especially opening night which is usually Friday, it’s like I’m sitting there in class the day of, wondering if I’m going to fall on my face, or if my costume is going to rip off, or if I’m going to be like Aubrey Posen off Pitch perfect who throws up... literally yacks her dinner on the whole front row.... GROSS. Performance day is so nerve wrecking because you don’t know what could happen, and let’s face it anything can happen it’s the 21st century.   </p>
   <h1>Why do I do it? </h1>
   <p>So you may be wondering, if you get so nervous and if you always have to play crazy characters then why the heck would you keep acting? Well the truth is even though I have not had that much experience with acing I love it, it is a true passion of mine I would love to pursue in the future. Yes, I get nervous and I get some pretty crazy characters, but I love it. The moment I step on that stage it’s like all my fears disappear. You see playing a different character is actually really fun you get to be someone else and escape reality for a couple of hours, and not many things can help you do that. Omg I almost forgot about the most important thing when it comes to acting, the cast. The cast is so important they are like a second family, and they make the day of the play a lot less stressful. Literally they are the funniest people I ever met. So, I guess that’s why I do it, acting is a dream I hope to carry on. </p>
